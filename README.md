# Favourite Things Assignment
This assignment is used to showcase a few of my favourite things. I feature my love for hockey, music, and video games.
This project makes me feel like Maria, but is a good way to showcase my understanding of JSON objects.

# Installation
This project simply requires you to download the project folder, and you'll be good to go!

# Usage
Once you've downloaded the project folder, open the index.html file in any internet browser of your choice and play around with the functionality.

# Contributing
This project was made by ME! Sasha Ahrens. (However, I would be remissed if I didn't mention the resources online...)
